#Git
Git is the preferred VCS. Unless there is a technical reason it is unsuited, every code project should be in a git repository.

##Branches
A feature or fix branch name includes the identifier of the task it is related to (JIRA or otherwise), to facilitate hooks and to make work traceable in both directions.
